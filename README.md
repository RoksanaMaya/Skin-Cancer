# Multimodal Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Risk Prediction
## Integrating Dermoscopic Images and Clinical Metadata


## Overview

This project develops an AI-driven risk assessment model for skin cancer detection. It integrates dermoscopic image analysis with patient-specific clinical metadata to assign a risk level (low, moderate, or high) to each lesion.

## Features

* Deep Learning Model: Uses MobileNetV2 for image feature extraction.

* Clinical Data Integration: Combines age, sex, and lesion localization.

* Risk-Based Categorization: Classifies lesions into low, moderate, or high-risk levels.

* Explainability: Implements Grad-CAM and SHAP values for interpretability.

* Early Detection & Triage: Prioritizes high-risk cases and reduces unnecessary biopsies.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

* Dataset: HAM10000 dataset (10,015 dermoscopic images).

***Image Preprocessing:***

* Resized to 128x128 pixels.

* Normalized pixel values.

* Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.).

 ***Clinical Data Processing:***

* Missing values removed.

* Categorical data encoded.

* Age normalized.

***Risk Category Mapping:***

* Labels converted to three risk categories: Low, Moderate, High.

### 2. Model Architecture

**CNN-based Image Processing:**

*MobileNetV2 extracts features.

*Flattened & passed through dense layers.

**DNN-based Clinical Data Processing:**

*Fully connected layers process clinical metadata.

**Multimodal Fusion:**

*Image & clinical data concatenated.

*Dense layer predicts risk level.

### 3. Training & Evaluation

**Training:**

*Adam optimizer.

*Sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

**Evaluation:**

*Accuracy & loss analysis.

*Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).

*Confusion matrix for misclassification analysis.

### 4. Deployment & Future Improvements

**Planned Enhancements:**

*Address class imbalance with SMOTE.

*Improve generalization with dropout & tuning.

*Collect diverse dataset for better generalizability.

**Potential Applications:**

*Telemedicine & remote dermatology screening.

*Integration with clinical decision support systems.

## Challenges

**Dataset Limitations:

*Class imbalance with a dominance of benign lesions.

*Lack of longitudinal data to track lesion progression.

*Limited diversity in demographics, potentially affecting generalizability.

**Model-Related Challenges:**

*Low recall for high-risk lesions.

*Overfitting on training data.

*Simplified risk categorization instead of continuous risk scores.

*Balancing image and metadata feature importance.

**Technical Constraints:**

*High computational requirements for deep learning models.

*Challenges in AI explainability for clinical trust.

**Deployment Issues:**

*Need for real-world validation in clinical settings.

*Ethical and legal concerns regarding AI-based diagnosis.

## Conclusion

Skin cancer remains a significant global health issue, and early detection is key to improving patient outcomes. This project presents a risk-based AI model that integrates deep learning for image analysis with structured clinical metadata, offering a more nuanced classification than traditional models. Despite challenges like dataset limitations, class imbalance, and model generalization, the proposed approach demonstrates promise in enhancing dermatological decision-making. Future improvements, such as dataset expansion, better generalization techniques, and real-world validation, will help refine this model for clinical applications. AI-assisted diagnostic tools like this have the potential to revolutionize skin cancer screening, reduce unnecessary biopsies, and save lives.
