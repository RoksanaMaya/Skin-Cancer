# Multimodal Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Risk Prediction
## Integrating Dermoscopic Images and Clinical Metadata


##Overview

This project develops an AI-driven risk assessment model for skin cancer detection. It integrates dermoscopic image analysis with patient-specific clinical metadata to assign a risk level (low, moderate, or high) to each lesion.

## Features

* Deep Learning Model: Uses MobileNetV2 for image feature extraction.

* Clinical Data Integration: Combines age, sex, and lesion localization.

* Risk-Based Categorization: Classifies lesions into low, moderate, or high-risk levels.

* Explainability: Implements Grad-CAM and SHAP values for interpretability.

* Early Detection & Triage: Prioritizes high-risk cases and reduces unnecessary biopsies.

## Workflow

* **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

* Dataset: HAM10000 dataset (10,015 dermoscopic images).

* **Image Preprocessing:**

* Resized to 128x128 pixels.

* Normalized pixel values.

* Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.).

* **Clinical Data Processing:**

* Missing values removed.

* Categorical data encoded.

* Age normalized.

* **Risk Category Mapping:**

Labels converted to three risk categories: Low, Moderate, High.
